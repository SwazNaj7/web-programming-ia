                <p class="chapter-text">
                    The message behind this chapter is that goals provide direction and purpose in life. Writing goals down makes them more tangible and helps
                    turn thoughts or dreams into action. While success takes time, anyone can begin moving toward it by deciding
                    to change direction and act with purpose.

                    This lesson reinforced that goals act as a compass for how I spend my time and energy. To grow, I need to be deliberate 
                    about setting clear, written goals and reviewing them regularly.

                <h3 class="chapter-subheading">Summary</h3>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    This chapter talks about time being one of life's most valuable resources and using it wisely requires discipline. 
                    We all face a choice between discipline and the lasting pain of regret. Focusing on what's truly important
                    rather than what only feels urgent ensures that time is invested in things truly matter.

                <h3 class="chapter-subheading">Reflection</h3>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    This chapter reminded me that being busy doesn't always mean being productive. You should prioritize tasks that
                    align with long-term goals and reduce time spent on distractions. Going forward, I plan to structure my days
                    more intentionally and focus on more meaningful work.

                    Growth is influenced by the company one keeps. Being around people who challenge and inspire you fosters
                    progress, while negative influences can hold you back. Choosing to associate with positive,
                    driven, and supportive individuals helps create an environment where personal and professional success can thrive.

                <p class="chapter-text">
                    This reminded me how much my environment and relationships shape my mindset and growth. I've realized the
                    importance of surrounding myself with people who encourage ambition, positivity, and accountability.

                    Success comes from continuous learning and curiosity. It is a
                    lifelong process of reading, listening and applying new ideas. Staying open to learning ensures
                    constant growth and adaptation in a constantly changing world.
