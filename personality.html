                    <p>This quote resonates with me because I feel like I'm constantly juggling a lot. Different responsibilities, people, as well as expectations. 
                        Life can get messy and overwhelming but this reminds me that I don't need to have everything figured out or perfect. What matters is keeping things simple
                        when it gets messy.</p>
